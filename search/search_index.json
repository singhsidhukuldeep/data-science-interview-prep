Not only this, the platform will also serve as one point destination for all your needs like tutorials, online materials, etc. This platform is maintained by you! \ud83e\udd17 You can help us by answering/ improving existing questions as well as by sharing any new questions that you faced during your interviews. Contribute to the platform Contribution in any form will be deeply appreciated. \ud83d\ude4f Add questions \u2753 Add your questions here . Please ensure to provide a detailed description to allow your fellow contributors to understand your questions and answer them to your satisfaction. \ud83e\udd1d Please note that as of now, you cannot directly add a question via a pull request. This will help us to maintain the quality of the content for you . Add answers/topics \ud83d\udcdd These are the answers/topics that need your help at the moment Add documentation for the project Online Material for Learning Cheat Sheets Django Flask Numpy Pandas PySpark Python RegEx SQL Add python common DSA interview questions Add Major ML topics Linear Regression Logistic Regression SVM Random Forest Gradient boosting PCA Collaborative Filtering K-means clustering kNN ARIMA Neural Networks Decision Trees Overfitting, Underfitting Unbalanced, Skewed data Activation functions relu/ leaky relu Normalization DBSCAN Normal Distribution Precision, Recall Loss Function MAE, RMSE Add Pandas questions Add NumPy questions Add TensorFlow questions Add PyTorch questions Add list of learning resources Issues \ud83d\udd27 To report any issues find me on LinkedIn or raise an issue on GitHub. \ud83d\udee0 You can also solve existing issues on GitHub and create a pull request. Setup No setup is required for usage of the platform Important: It is strongly advised to use virtual environment and not change anything in gh-pages Linux Systems python3 -m venv ./venv source venv/bin/activate pip3 install -r requirements.txt deactivate Windows Systems python3 -m venv ./venv venv \\S cripts \\a ctivate pip3 install -r requirements.txt venv \\S cripts \\d eactivate To install the latest pip3 install mkdocs pip3 install mkdocs-material Useful Commands mkdocs serve - Start the live-reloading docs server. mkdocs build - Build the documentation site. mkdocs -h - Print help message and exit. mkdocs gh-deploy - Use mkdocs gh-deploy --help to get a full list of options available for the gh-deploy command. Be aware that you will not be able to review the built site before it is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, you may want to verify any changes you make to the docs beforehand by using the build or serve commands and reviewing the built files locally. mkdocs new [dir-name] - Create a new project. No need to create a new project Useful Documents \ud83d\udcd1 MkDocs: https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs \ud83c\udfa8 Theme: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material FAQ Can I filter questions based on companies? \ud83e\udd2a As much as this platform aims to help you with your interview preparation, it is not a short-cut to crack one. Think of this platform as a practicing field to help you sharpen your skills for your interview processes. However, for your convenience we have sorted all the questions by topics for you. \ud83e\udd13 This doesn't mean that such feature won't be added in the future. \"Never say Never\" But as of now there is neither plan nor data to do so. \ud83d\ude22 Why is this platform free? \ud83e\udd17 Currently there is no major cost involved in maintaining this platform other than time and effort that is put in by every contributor . If you want to help you can contribute here . If you still want to pay for something that is free, we would request you to donate it to a charity of your choice instead. \ud83d\ude07 Credits Maintained by \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf93 Kuldeep Singh Sidhu Github: github/singhsidhukuldeep https://github.com/singhsidhukuldeep Website: Kuldeep Singh Sidhu (Website) http://kuldeepsinghsidhu.com LinkedIn: Kuldeep Singh Sidhu (LinkedIn) https://www.linkedin.com/in/singhsidhukuldeep/ Contributors \ud83d\ude0e The full list of all the contributors is available here Current Status","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This is a completely open-source platform for maintaining curated list of interview questions and answers for people looking and preparing for data science opportunities.
