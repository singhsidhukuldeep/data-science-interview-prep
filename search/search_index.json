Your aim is to get the highest score you can, in at-most 3 roles. A score is defined as the number that appears on the face of the dice facing up after the role. You can role at most 3 times but every time you role it is up to you to decide whether you want to role again. The last score will be counted as your final score. Find the average score if you rolled the dice only once? Find the average score that you can get with at most 3 roles? If the dice is fair, why is the average score for at most 3 roles and 1 role not the same? Answer If you role a fair dice once you can get: Score Probability 1 \u2159 2 \u2159 3 \u2159 4 \u2159 5 \u2159 6 \u2159 So your average score with one role is: sum of(score * scores's probability) = (1+2+3+4+5+6)*(\u2159) = (21/6) = 3.5 The average score if you rolled the dice only once is 3.5 For at most 3 roles, let's try back-tracking. Let's say just did your second role and you have to decide whether to do your 3 rd role! We just found out if we role dice once on average we can expect score of 3.5. So we will only role the 3 rd time if score on 2 nd role is less than 3.5 i.e (1,2 or 3) Possibilities 2 nd role score Probability 3 rd role score Probability 1 \u2159 3.5 \u2159 2 \u2159 3.5 \u2159 3 \u2159 3.5 \u2159 4 \u2159 NA We won't role 5 \u2159 NA 3 rd time if we 6 \u2159 NA get score >3 on 2 nd So if we had 2 roles, average score would be: [We role again if current score is less than 3.4] (3.5)*(1/6) + (3.5)*(1/6) + (3.5)*(1/6) + (4)*(1/6) + (5)*(1/6) + (6)*(1/6) [Decide not to role again] = 1.75 + 2.5 = 4.25 The average score if you rolled the dice twice is 4.25 So now if we look from the perspective of first role. We will only role again if our score is less than 4.25 i.e 1,2,3 or 4 Possibilities 1 st role score Probability 2 nd and 3 rd role score Probability 1 \u2159 4.25 \u2159 2 \u2159 4.25 \u2159 3 \u2159 4.25 \u2159 4 \u2159 4.25 \u2159 5 \u2159 NA We won't role again if we 6 \u2159 NA get score >4.25 on 1 st So if we had 3 roles, average score would be: [We role again if current score is less than 4.25] (4.25)*(1/6) + (4.25)*(1/6) + (4.25)*(1/6) + (4.25)*(1/6) + (5)*(1/6) + (6)*(1/6) [[Decide not to role again] = 17/6 + 11/6 = 4.66 The average score if you rolled the dice only once is 4.66 The average score for at most 3 roles and 1 role is not the same because although the dice is fair the event of rolling the dice is no longer independent . The scores would have been the same if we rolled the dice 2 nd and 3 rd time without considering what we got in the last roll i.e. if the event of rolling the dice was independent.","title":"Probability"},{"location":"Interview-Questions/Probability/#probability-interview-questions","text":"","title":"Probability Interview Questions"},{"location":"Interview-Questions/Probability/#average-score-on-a-dice-role-of-at-most-3-times","text":"Question Consider a fair 6-sided dice. Your aim is to get the highest score you can, in at-most 3 roles. A score is defined as the number that appears on the face of the dice facing up after the role. You can role at most 3 times but every time you role it is up to you to decide whether you want to role again. The last score will be counted as your final score. Find the average score if you rolled the dice only once? Find the average score that you can get with at most 3 roles? If the dice is fair, why is the average score for at most 3 roles and 1 role not the same? Answer If you role a fair dice once you can get: Score Probability 1 \u2159 2 \u2159 3 \u2159 4 \u2159 5 \u2159 6 \u2159 So your average score with one role is: sum of(score * scores's probability) = (1+2+3+4+5+6)*(\u2159) = (21/6) = 3.5 The average score if you rolled the dice only once is 3.5 For at most 3 roles, let's try back-tracking.
