This is a completely open-source platform for maintaining curated list of interview questions and answers for people looking and preparing for data science opportunities.

Not only this, the platform will also serve as one point destination for all your needs like tutorials, online materials, etc.

**This platform is maintained by you!** ðŸ¤— You can <a href="/Contribute"><u>help us</u></a> by answering/ improving existing questions as well as by sharing any new questions that you faced during your interviews. You can also improve topics and articles.
