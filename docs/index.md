## Setup

> No setup is required for usage of the platform

**Important:** *It is strongly advised to use virtual environment and not change anything in `gh-pages`*

### `Linux` Systems

```shell
python3 -m venv ./venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```shell
deactivate
```

### `Windows` Systems

python3 -m venv ./venv

venv\Scripts\activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```shell
venv\Scripts\deactivate
```

### To install the latest

```shell
pip3 install mkdocs

## Useful Commands

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
* `mkdocs gh-deploy` - Use `mkdocs gh-deploy --help` to get a full list of options available for the `gh-deploy` command.
    Be aware that you will not be able to review the built site before it is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, you may want to verify any changes you make to the docs beforehand by using the `build` or `serve` commands and reviewing the built files locally.
* ~~`mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.~~ No need to create a new project

## FAQ

* Can I filter questions based on companies? 🤪

As much as this platform is meant to help with your interview preparation. It is not a sure shot short-cut to cracking an interview.
Think of this platform where you practice the skills that you have from a interview perspective, 
keeping that in mind the questions are sorted by topics but not by companies. 🤓

This doesn't mean that such feature won't be added in the future. "*Never say Never*" But as of now neither there is a plan nor data to do so. 😢

* Why is this platform free? 🤗

Currently there is no major cost involved in maintaining this project other than time and effort that is put in by every [contributor](https://github.com/singhsidhukuldeep/data-science-interview-prep/graphs/contributors). 
If you want to help you can [contribute here](#contribute-to-the-project). 

If you still want to pay for something that is free, we would request you to donate it to a charity 😇 of your choice instead.
